# Governance for this Template

We aspire to a transparent governance process, the overall governance for this project should be contained in the GOVERNANCE file and requires formal voting from members in the MAINTAINERS file, such as making proposals to add new maintainers or performing releases. Just contributing does not make you a maintainer immediately, it is about building trust with the current maintainers by making decisions in the best interest of the project. 

Voting may be accomplished by stating +1 (approve), 0 (abstain), -1 (disapprove) on the primary communication medium. Voting SHOULD remain open for a <insert time frame> (week?) to collect feedback from the wider community and allow the maintainers to digest the proposal.

* **MAINTAINERS**: list of maintainers (name + email)

    * Limit one maintainer per organization (country and NGO)

* **GOVERNANCE**: governance process

    * Adding a maintainer (requires supermajority vote from maintainers)

    * Removing a maintainer (requires supermajority vote from maintainers)

    * A maintainer SHOULD propose a motion on the primary communication medium (e.g., GitHub or the mailing list)

    * The project governance rules itself may be modified via a formal vote via the list of maintainers requiring super majority vote

    * Maintainers SHOULD develop a maintainer handover process including means to ensuring the maintainer count does not drop below two

* **RELEASES**: release policy and process

    * The release process hopes to encourage early, consistent consensus-building during project development. A formal release of the template requires a simple majority vote from the list of maintainers.

* **CONTRIBUTING**: contributing guidelines

    * Contributions are welcome and need to be submitted through the primary communication channel (e.g., GitHub Pull Requests)
