# foss-contrib-policy-template

## Objectives:

 * Define a template free/open-source contribution policy that governments can instantiate
 * Increase contributions from civil servants and subcontractors working for governments
 * Help governments interact and work together
 * Propose best practices on engaging with open-source communities and contribute new projects
